# Tox Library

A collection of .tox components for TouchDesigner. Includes several implementations of GPU algorithms as well as other handy components.

## clt_cloak

> Cloth simulation using a custom operator (get it [here](https://github.com/vininja/ClothTOP)).

## clt_inflatable

> Inflatable simulation using a custom operator (get it [here](https://github.com/vininja/ClothTOP)).

## jumping_flood_3d

> Multipass implementation of the Jumping Flood algorithm to calculate a signed-distance (SDF) field from a volume texture.

## kinectv1

> Module for Kinect V1 with world space from depth calculation.

## physarum3d

> Compute shader implementation of the Physarum Automata algorithm in three dimensions.

## raymarcher_3dtex

> Density and isosurface raymarcher renderer for volume textures.

## deform_mesh_pbr
> Geometry component that deforms the input mesh based on position and normal textures.
